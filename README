For this preprocessing pipeline, we recommend the conversion of DICOM files to NIfTI format, to facilitate the use of CT_BET by aqqush (https://github.com/aqqush/CT_BET)

Python imports
1. dicom2nifti
2. numpy
3. nibabel
4. nilearn
5. itertools
6. fslmaths

Preprocessing steps are as follows:

(1) Conversion of DICOM to NIfTI files with dicom2nifti (https://github.com/icometrix/dicom2nifti)

(2) Resampling the files to a particular size (default 512 x 512 x X, where X is the original number for slices for the scan)
    > This is required as the CT_BET requires (512 X 512 sized slices to work
    > This is carried out by rescaling the affine matrix of the NIfTI file as suggested by effigies, leej3, ellisdg and Shotgunosine (https://github.com/nipy/nibabel/issues/670)

(3) Run CT_BET on the scan
    > Instructions to run from CT_BET by aqqush (https://github.com/aqqush/CT_BET)
    > Creates a mask of the area around the brain parenchyma
    
(4) Apply the mask from the CT_BET on the original image to obtain the extracted brain image
    > The mask from the previous step can be applied with fslmaths, multiplying the values of each voxel from the mask to the respective voxel on the original image
    
(5) Recentre the brain
    > After extraction, we centre the brain on the image by cropping the scan with nilearn.image.crop_img which removes the zeroes on the scan leaving us with a cropped image
    > Subsequently, we pad the images back to the original size using numpy.pad
    
(6) Further resampling (optional)
    > At this point we have the image ready to be passed through your machine learning code
    > However, resampling might be required to standardise all images to a particular set of dimensions (X, Y, Z)
    > You might also want to downsample the images for testing your code prior
    
These steps are individually placed in python scripts in the repository, and also a combined script I use to run the whole thing on multiple files in a folder
For the use of CT_BET, the folder required can be obtained from the link above and the weights file has to be obtained there as well.
